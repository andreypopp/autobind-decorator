# autobind decorator

A class or method decorator which binds methods to the instance
so `this` is always correct, even when the method is detached.

This is particularly useful for situations like React components, where
you often pass methods as event handlers and would otherwise need to
`.bind(this)`.
```
Before:
<button onClick={ this.handleClick.bind(this) }></button>

After:
<button onClick={ this.handleClick }></button>
```

As decorators are a part of future ES2016 standard they can only be used with
transpilers such as [Babel](http://babeljs.io).

**Note Babel 6 users:**
The implementation of the decorator transform is currently on hold as the syntax
is not final. If you would like to use this project with Babel 6.0, you may use
[babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy)
which implement Babel 5 decorator transform for Babel 6.

Installation:

    % npm install autobind-decorator

Example:

    import autobind from 'autobind-decorator'

    class Component {

      constructor(value) {
        this.value = value
      }

      @autobind
      method() {
        return this.value
      }
    }

    let component = new Component(42)
    let method = component.method // .bind(component) isn't needed!
    method() // returns 42


    // Also usable on the class to bind all methods

    @autobind
    class Component { }

    // If you only want to bind certain methods, use the matching mode

    @autobind(/^(handle)/)
    class Component {
      // Bound to instance
      handleClick(e) {}

      // Not bound to instnace
      render() {}
    }

    // You can invert the matching by passing `true` as the second argument.

    @autobind(/^(render)/, true)
    class Component {
      // Not bound to instance.
      render() {}
    }
